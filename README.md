# The Movie Database Search App
First of all, run `yarn` to install dependencies and replace `key` in `src/utils/request.js` with your own TMDb Api key. Then use:
* `yarn start` to start dev server,
* `yarn build` to build production version,
* `yarn flow` to do a types check,
* `yarn test` to run unit and snapshot tests,
* `yarn storybook` to view living documentation,

Handle with care ;-)
